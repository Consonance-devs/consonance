1
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:16,818
I used to rule the world

2
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:19,382
Seas would rise when I gave the word

3
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:23,063
Now in the morning I sleep alone

4
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:27,511
Sweep the streets I used to own

5
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:44,351
I used to roll the dice

6
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:47,671
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

7
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:51,358
Listen as the crowd would sing

8
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:54,358
"Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!"

9
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:57,982
One minute I held the key

10
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:01,055
Next the walls were closed on me

11
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:05,039
And I discovered that my castles stand

12
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:08,542
Upon pillars of salt
and pillars of sand

13
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:12,799
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

14
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:16,239
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

15
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,519
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

16
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:23,319
My missionaries in a foreign field

17
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,559
For some reason I can't explain

18
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:33,070
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word

19
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:37,415
And that was when I ruled the world

20
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,979
It was the wicked and wild wind

21
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:56,915
Blew down the doors to let me in

22
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:00,843
Shattered windows
and the sound of drums

23
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:04,020
People couldn't believe
what I'd become

24
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,939
Revolutionaries wait

25
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:10,723
For my head on a silver plate

26
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:14,755
Just a puppet on a lonely string

27
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:18,123
Oh who would ever want to be king?

28
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:22,372
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

29
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,643
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

30
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,347
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

31
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:32,748
My missionaries in a foreign field

32
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:36,180
For some reason I can't explain

33
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:39,444
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

34
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:42,579
Never an honest word

35
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:46,875
But that was when I ruled the world

36
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:18,143
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

37
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:21,391
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

38
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:24,846
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

39
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,422
My missionaries in a foreign field

40
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:31,655
For some reason I can't explain

41
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:35,023
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

42
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,094
Never an honest word

43
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:42,526
But that was when I ruled the world
