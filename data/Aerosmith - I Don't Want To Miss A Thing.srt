1
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:37,744
I could stay awake
just to hear you breathing

2
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,352
Watch you smile while you are sleeping

3
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,417
While you're far away and dreaming

4
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:53,728
I could spend my life
in this sweet surrender

5
00:00:54,336 --> 00:01:01,392
I could stay lost in this moment
forever

6
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,153
Well, every moment spent with you

7
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:09,272
Is a moment I treasure

8
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:15,137
I don't wanna close my eyes

9
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,181
I don't wanna fall asleep

10
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,158
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

11
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:23,238
And I don't wanna miss a thing

12
00:01:23,318 --> 00:01:27,110
'Cause even when I dream of you

13
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:29,870
The sweetest dream would never do

14
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,302
I'd still miss you, baby

15
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:35,383
And I don't wanna miss a thing

16
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:44,342
Lying close to you

17
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:49,062
Feeling your heart beating

18
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,694
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming

19
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:57,662
Wondering if it's me you're seeing

20
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:05,070
Then I kiss your eyes
and thank God we're together

21
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,742
And I just wanna stay with you

22
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:14,654
In this moment forever,
forever and ever

23
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:18,494
I don't wanna close my eyes

24
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,478
I don't wanna fall asleep

25
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:23,718
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

26
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:27,040
And I don't wanna miss a thing

27
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:30,701
'Cause even when I dream of you

28
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:33,478
The sweetest dream would never do

29
00:02:33,614 --> 00:02:35,710
I'd still miss you, baby

30
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,862
And I don't wanna miss a thing

31
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:42,926
I don't wanna miss one smile

32
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:46,638
I don't wanna miss one kiss

33
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:49,324
Well, I just wanna be with you

34
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,339
Right here with you, just like this

35
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:58,517
I just wanna hold you close

36
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,299
Feel your heart so close to mine

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,826
And just stay here in this moment

38
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:09,960
For all the rest of time

39
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:20,226
Don't wanna close my eyes

40
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,081
Don't wanna fall asleep

41
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,359
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

42
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:28,408
And I don't wanna miss a thing

43
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:32,059
'Cause even when I dream of you

44
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:35,016
The sweetest dream would never do

45
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:37,216
'Cause I'd still miss you, baby

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,467
And I don't wanna miss a thing

47
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:44,107
I don't wanna close my eyes

48
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,088
I don't wanna fall asleep

49
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:49,368
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

50
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:52,272
And I don't wanna miss a thing

51
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:56,340
'Cause even when I dream of you

52
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:59,024
The sweetest dream would never do

53
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:01,002
I'd still miss you, baby

54
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:04,243
And I don't wanna miss a thing

55
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,547
Don't wanna close my eyes

56
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:12,867
Don't wanna fall asleep, yeah

57
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:16,156
I don't wanna miss a thing
