00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,600
(It starts with)

1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,100
One thing... I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,400
Keep that in mind I designed
this rhyme, To explain in due time

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,200
(All I know) Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,600
Watch it count down to the end
of the day, The clock ticks life away

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,200
(Its so unreal) Didnt look out below
Watch the time go right out the window

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,800
Trying to hold on but didnt even know
Wasted it all just to

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,600
(Watch you go) I kept everything
inside and even though I tried,
it all fell apart

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,600
What it meant to me, will eventually,
be a memory, of a time when
(I tried so hard and got so far)

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,700
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

10
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,600
I had to fall to lose it all

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,200
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,700
One thing I dont know why
It doesnt even matter how hard you try

13
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,900
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how (I tried so hard...)

14
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,100
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property

15
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,500
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Im surprised (it got so far...)

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Things arent the way they were before
You wouldnt even recognize me anymore

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,800
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,000
(In the end...)You kept everything inside
And even though I tried it all fell apart

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,300
What it meant to me, will eventually,
be a memory, of a time when
(I tried so hard and got so far)

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

21
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
I had to fall to lose it all

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,500
But in the end
It doesnt even matter...

23
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:19,000
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,100
For all this, Theres only 
one thing you should know...

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:37,600
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:46,400
For all this, Theres only one thing
you should know...

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,500
I tried so hard
And got so far

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
But in the end
It doesnt even matter

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I had to fall to lose it all

30
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,700
But in the end
It doesnt even matter...
