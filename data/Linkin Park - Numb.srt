1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,205
I'm tired of being
what you want me to be

2
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:29,990
Feeling so faithless,
lost under the surface

3
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,822
I don't know what you're
expecting of me

4
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:39,101
Put under the pressure,
of walking in your shoes

5
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:42,141
(Caught in the undertow,
just caught in the undertow)

6
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:47,758
Every step that I take is
another mistake to you...

7
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:50,853
(Caught in the undertow,
just caught in the undertow)

8
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:56,925
I've become so numb,
I can't feel you there

9
00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:01,052
Become so tired,
so much more aware

10
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:05,451
I'm becoming this,
all I want to do

11
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,537
Is be more like me
and be less like you

12
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:13,049
Can't you see that
you're smothering me?

13
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:18,090
Holding too tightly,
afraid to lose control

14
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:22,105
'Cause everything
that you thought I would be

15
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:27,050
Has fallen apart,
right in front of you

16
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:30,545
(Caught in the undertow,
just caught in the undertow)

17
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:35,932
Every step that I take
is another mistake to you

18
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:39,015
(Caught in the undertow,
just caught in the undertow)

19
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:43,976
An' every second I waste
is more than I can take...

20
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:49,053
I've become so numb,
I can't feel you there

21
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:53,087
Become so tired,
so much more aware

22
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,687
I'm becoming this,
all I want to do

23
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:02,281
Is be more like me
and be less like you

24
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:11,520
And I know
I may end up failing too

25
00:02:11,816 --> 00:02:20,701
But I know You were just like me,
with someone disappointed in you...

26
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:26,206
I've become so numb,
I can't feel you there

27
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:30,204
Become so tired,
so much more aware

28
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,780
I'm becoming this,
all I want to do

29
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:38,372
Is be more like me
and be less like you

30
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:43,604
I've become so numb,
I can't feel you there

31
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,861
(I'm tired of being
what you want me to be)

32
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:52,227
I've become so numb,
I can't feel you there

33
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,659
(I'm tired of being
what you want me to be)
