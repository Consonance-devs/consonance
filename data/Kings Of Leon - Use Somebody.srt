1
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:35,551
I've been roaming around,
I was looking down at all I see

2
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:42,815
Painted faces
fill the places I can't reach

3
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:47,432
You know that I could use somebody

4
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,056
You know that I could use somebody

5
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:04,428
Someone like you and all you know
and how you speak

6
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,316
Countless lovers
under cover of the street

7
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:16,197
You know that I could use somebody

8
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:23,309
You know that I could use somebody

9
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:28,876
Someone like you

10
00:01:54,701 --> 00:02:00,733
Off in the night while you live it up
I'm off to sleep

11
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:07,472
Waging wars to shake the poet
and the beat

12
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:11,936
I hope it's gonna make you notice

13
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:19,877
I hope it's gonna make you notice

14
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:32,029
Someone like me, someone like me

15
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:39,373
Someone like me, somebody

16
00:02:52,572 --> 00:03:02,402
I'm ready now

17
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:20,735
Someone like you, somebody

18
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:27,526
Someone like you, somebody

19
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,319
Someone like you, somebody

20
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:43,366
I've been roaming around,
I was looking down at all I see
